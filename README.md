# Social Media Network Ads Analytics Project

## Introduction

This project undertakes a detailed analysis of the 'Social Media Network Ads' dataset from Kaggle, focusing on the impact of user demographics on social media advertisement effectiveness. The primary objective is to identify demographic factors, such as age and income, that influence the likelihood of purchase conversions and to determine which segments are most responsive to ads. This insight is crucial for businesses looking to optimize their social media marketing strategies and improve their return on advertising spend.

## Research Question

The guiding research question for this project is:

**"How do demographic factors such as age and income influence the likelihood of a purchase following exposure to social media advertisements, and which demographic segments should be targeted to maximize return on advertising spend?"**

This question directs the analytical efforts towards uncovering actionable trends and relationships within the data.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis is available on Kaggle and can be found at the following link:

- [Social Media Network Ads Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asmitameghrajchaskar/social-media-network-ads?rvi=1)

It includes key demographic information about users, including whether they made a purchase after viewing a social media ad.

## Methodology

Using Python for data analysis, we processed and analyzed the dataset to calculate the purchase rates across different demographics, income groups, and age brackets. The analysis involved:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
- Segmenting users into meaningful groups based on age and income.
- Calculating the purchase rates for each segment.
- Identifying patterns and trends in the data.

Next, we will use Microsoft Power BI to visualize the data and make insights.

## Findings and Insights

The analysis of the 'Social Media Network Ads' dataset led to some compelling insights, particularly regarding the purchase rates across different age groups for both males and females. The visuals below depict the average purchase rate by age group for each gender:

- For females, the highest purchase rate was observed in the 50-64 age group, suggesting that women in this age bracket are the most responsive to social media ads.
- In contrast, the purchase rate for females in the 18-29 and 30-49 age groups was significantly lower.

- For males, the trend showed a similar pattern, with the 50-64 age group having the highest purchase rate, indicating a strong responsiveness in this demographic as well.

These trends provide a clear direction for advertisers; targeting the 50-64 age group could potentially yield higher conversion rates. However, it's also essential to consider the overall marketing strategy, product type, and the specific interests of the target demographic when tailoring ad campaigns.
